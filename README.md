## Codes


The main codes for our proposed models, including DGAE$_{\alpha}$, DGAE$_{\alpha}^{\beta}$, and DVGA$_{\alpha}^{\beta}$ in our paper " Codes of Stabilizing and Enhancing Link Prediction through Deepened Graph Auto-Encoders". The files in the subfolder "Python", are the Python source codes, which have been implemented in JupyterLab. For readability, we also provide the html files in the subfolder "Html".
